    "p1": "Regular maintenance of the technology - Although the extraction technologies are designed to handle high dust volumes, they still require regular maintenance. A reduction in their efficiency leads to an increase in dust in the hall and its surroundings and, as a consequence, dust limits set by hygiene standards are exceeded.",
    "p2": "Cleaning of pneumatic conveying systems - a pneumatic waste conveying system can be part of the waste treatment technology. Due to the variety of waste composition, dirt can settle in the piping. Therefore, the piping needs to be cleaned regularly to establish reliable operation of the entire technology.",
    "p3": "Cleaning of waste disposal chutes - a completely separate area in waste management are waste disposal chutes in residential buildings. The chutes require regular maintenance and cleaning to ensure hygienic conditions and to prevent the spread of odours in the residential buildings.",
