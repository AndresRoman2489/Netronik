          "Work on the first JettyRobot prototype began in 2008. We designed it to clean ventilation systems and industrial exhausts using the dry ice blasting method.",
          "The first prototype saw the light of day in May 2009. This was followed by extensive testing, development, innovation and, most importantly, experience gathering. We launched the first robot in an industrial environment at the turn of 2011 and 2012. Development followed again. We were keen to bring to market the best in the industry."

          "In 2017, the JettyRobot company was formed from the project. From the original focus on ducts and industrial exhausts, we target work in many pipes and ducts. We weren't afraid of a challenge and that's when our claim \"Your Duct & Pipe Insider\" was born, accurately reflecting our change in focus.",
          "JettyRobot robots became a versatile platform that transports technology into pipes and manages the relevant operations. We emphasize maximum flexibility of the solution so that tool changes can be handled quickly and easily on-site.",
          "One robot can cover a wide range of operations with just a tool change. Our concept significantly increases work efficiency, shortens lead times and reduces operator training requirements as the operator works with the same robot over and over again."
