  "overview": {
    "p1": "Pipeline inspection is an important part of preventive maintenance systems across all industries. You minimise the risk of accidents and prevent unplanned downtime. Every shutdown means high economic losses.",
    "p2": "A variety of tools can be fitted to JettyRobot to allow the selection of a suitable method. In many cases, the necessary first step to inspect a pipe is to clean it.",
    "p3": "A significant advantage of the JettyRobot is that the transition between cleaning and inspection only means changing the tool installed on the robot.",
    "p4": "JettyRobot's manoeuvrability allows it to work in bends and verticals. Its reach helps reduce work volume and access costs. Savings come mainly from reducing disconnections and the volume of potential excavation works.",
