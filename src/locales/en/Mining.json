    "p1": "In mining, pipelines are used to transport raw materials efficiently during processing, often with a water stream.",
    "p2": "Pipes are equipped with an internal lining to prevent abrasive wear. If the lining is damaged, it can stick and later block the pipe. Without controlling lining wear, the pipeline itself can suffer progressive damage, causing incidents and shutdowns. In this industry, shutdowns mean high economic losses."
