    "title": "What Problems Customers Solve Most Often",
    "p1": "Production technology with industrial exhausts – air flowing through the duct carries dirt particles to the outlet filters, RTO technology, etc. Dirt particles settle in the duct and dirty ducts cause problems in the production process.",
    "p2": "Production technology with clean outdoor air supply – the air contains dust particles that settle in the ductwork and over time can start to cause problems in the production process.",
    "p3": "Cleaning of pipelines for the transport of individual product components – most often pneumatic conveying. Between changes in production recipes, an efficient, quick and hygienic cleaning of the transport route is necessary to avoid cross-contamination of products.",

      "The production process requires cleaning of conveyor lines when changing the recipe to avoid cross-contamination of products.",
      "The production technology is not working properly because the exhaust from the technology or the air supply to the technology is clogged.",
      "The Fire Authority requires fire safety and part of the measure is to clean the exhaust from the technology and/or the air-handling system.",
      "The quality department requires high standards in production to ensure and declare quality to customers. The process typically includes the introduction of regular cleaning of exhaust and supply air in production.",
      "Production requires cleaning of part of the technology without shutting down the entire system, or needs to reduce downtime for maintenance."
