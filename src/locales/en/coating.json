    "p1": "Protective coatings on the internal surfaces of pipes are common across many industries. Their purpose can be corrosion protection, reduced friction, and preventing atom migration from the conveyed medium into the pipe material. Proper surface preparation is essential.",
    "p2": "Coatings are applied to both new and in-service pipelines. In the latter, dismantling the pipe is difficult or impossible, which makes JettyRobot ideal.",
    "p3": "JettyRobot can be equipped as an applicator depending on the coating material and technology used, always together with a well-designed cleaning and substrate preparation.",
    "p4": "JettyRobot’s manoeuvrability enables work in bends and verticals, significantly reducing access time and costs."
